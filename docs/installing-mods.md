# Installing Mods

As of December 2023, modding in Cities: Skylines 2 is still very much so "unofficial" and not using the Paradox systems. As such, a distribution platform is needed.

## Distribution Platforms

Currently, there are two major ones being used, [Thunderstore.io](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/) and [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/citiesskylines2/mods/).

This article will specifically focus on Thunderstore and r2modman, the mod manager client. The reasons for this are entirely subjective judgement by the writer, but I have used both Vortex (For Nexus Mods) and r2modman many times over the years. 10/10 times, I'd take r2modman if given the option between using one or the other. It's more simplistic and just feature rich enough to make modding easy without adding too much over top that.

## Thunderstore.io

Thunderstore is a lot like Nexus Mods and other sites which support multiple games. Clicking 'Communities' at the top of the page will show you the list of games on the platform. You can either directly access the community by bookmarking [this URL](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/) or just navigate the dropdown each visit.

The very first item in the list of mods you will see is called r2modman. This is the client used to download mods from Thunderstore without managing them manually. It will also keep your game files always in a vanilla state and only load mods at runtime.

Download this first by clicking on r2modman in the mod list, then click Manual Download. Extra and run the setup. You can also get the latest release from their [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases).
