# Contributing

We encourage the community to submit changes to this documentation. Documentation is a tedious process and often under appreciated for the effort. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!

## Configuration

This wiki is maintained using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), pages are written in Markdown and rendered with [marked](https://marked.js.org/). For Markdown compatibility, see the [documentation from marked on supported specifications](https://marked.js.org/#specifications).

We are using the following Docsify plugins:

- Full-text search
- Image zoom
- Copy code to clipboard
- Pagination
- [Edit on GitHub](https://github.com/njleonzhang/docsify-edit-on-github)

> Note: Any plugin above without a hyperlink can be found on [the Docsify Plugins page](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins).

## Standards

Please follow these basic formatting requests:

- Use spellcheck
- Keep content specific to Cities: Skylines 2 modding
- Do not upload any media you do not own the copyright for
- All submissions are treated as licensed under the same license we use for this entire wiki
- GitHub links should reference specific commits, not a link to a specific branch. This ensures that the URL will continue to work should the file, branch, etc. end up no longer existing or get moved
  - Example:
    - Good: `https://github.com/optimus-code/Cities2Modding/blob/663efb15ac94de76e80b18a9d89eb3c1476279db/ExampleMod/MonoBehaviours/MusicLoader.cs`
    - Bad: `https://github.com/optimus-code/Cities2Modding/blob/main/ExampleMod/MonoBehaviours/MusicLoader.cs`
