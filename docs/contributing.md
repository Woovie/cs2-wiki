# Contributing

We encourage the community to submit changes to this documentation. Documentation is a tedious process and often under appreciated for the effort. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated!

## Configuration

This wiki is maintained using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), pages are written in Markdown and rendered with [marked](https://marked.js.org/). For Markdown compatibility, see the [documentation from marked on supported specifications](https://marked.js.org/#specifications).

We are using the following Docsify plugins:

- Full-text search
- Image zoom
- Copy code to clipboard
- Pagination
- [Edit on GitHub](https://github.com/njleonzhang/docsify-edit-on-github)

> Note: If you cannot find the link above, it is likely that [the plugin is on the Docsify Plugins page](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins) without a link to any specific project.
