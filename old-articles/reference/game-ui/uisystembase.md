# UISystemBase

> Base class for extending with your own UIs

Used for setting up Bindings between the C# <> Game UI parts of the game. The communication is bi-directional, so you can Trigger events from the Game UI to make things happen in your mod, but you can also send data from the mod to the Game UI.
